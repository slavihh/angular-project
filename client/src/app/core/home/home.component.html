        The main purpose of this app is a school markbook with different subjects and assessments according to the students. We have one Administrator profile that can add marks, simple subjects, or subjects already created to given students. Marks can be added to students and subject who already have this subject. Any school subject can be deleted or edited by the administrator. Ordinary users (students) can only see their subjects and marks. Guests must be logged in to use the application.

          "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
